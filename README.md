# Programming 3 Exercise project
This is a 2-person group project from the course Programming 3: Techniques TIE-02402

This project was pulled from gitLab.

The documentation was done in Finnish, which can be found in Documentation/Dokumentaatio.pdf. Use Google trastate to translate the text to the desired language ;)

NOTE: This seems not to work with Qt 6, but was tested to work with Qt 5.15.2
